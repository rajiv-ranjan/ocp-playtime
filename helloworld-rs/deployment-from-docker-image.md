We have two choices to create the docker image

*   Use s2i to build from source code
*   Use s2i to build from binary (war file)

### Method 1: Image Creation from source 
### Method 2: Image creation from binary
### Method 3: Image creation from SCM

```sh
s2i build --pull-policy=never --context-dir=helloworld-rs https://github.com/rajiv-ranjan/ocp-playtime registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-eap-7/eap71-openshift eap-app
```
